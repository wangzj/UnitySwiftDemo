Xcode Manipulation module
=========================

This is an Xcode Manipulation module maintained by the Unity mobile team.

The module is bundled with Unity 5.0 and newer. The documentation of the version bundled with 
Unity is provided here http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/iOS.Xcode.PBXProject.html.

The open source version of the code is put in UnityEditor.iOS.Xcode.Custom namespace by 
default to avoid conflicts with the DLL bundled within Unity.
